ðŸ“Œ Task Objective
The objective of this project is to predict heart disease based on patient medical data using machine learning techniques.
 The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to identify key factors contributing to heart disease risk.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Used
Dataset Name: Heart Disease UCI Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Heart Disease UCI

Description: Contains patient records with features like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol,
 fasting blood sugar, ECG results, maximum heart rate, and more.

Target Variable: target (1 = Heart disease present, 0 = No heart disease)

ðŸ¤– Models Applied
Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Gradient Boosting Classifier

ðŸ“ˆ Key Results & Findings
Best Performing Model: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy Achieved: ~89%

Feature selection showed that factors like age, max heart rate (thalach), chest pain type, and exercise-induced angina are strong predictors.

The model can help in early detection and decision support for medical professionals.
